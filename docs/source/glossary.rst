        A Python package -- i.e. a directory of code -- that contains all the
        settings for an instance of Corral. This would include database
        configuration, Corral-specific options and application-specific
        settings.

    MVC
        Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern for
        implementing user interfaces on computers. It divides a given software
        application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate
        internal representations of information from the ways that information
        is presented to or accepted from the user.
