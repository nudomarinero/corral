    abstract = {In the last decade a new generation of telescopes and sensors has allowed the production of a very large amount of data and astronomy has become, a data-rich science; this transition is often labeled as: "data revolution" and "data tsunami". The first locution puts emphasis on the expectations of the astronomers while the second stresses, instead, the dramatic problem arising from this large amount of data: which is no longer computable with traditional approaches to data storage, data reduction and data analysis. In a new, age new instruments are necessary, as it happened in the Bronze age when mankind left the old instruments made out of stone to adopt the new, better ones made with bronze. Everything changed, even the social structure. In a similar way, this new age of Astronomy calls for a new generation of tools and, for a new methodological approach to many problems, and for the acquisition of new skills. The attems to find a solution to this problems falls under the umbrella of a new discipline which originated by the intersection of astronomy, statistics and computer science: Astroinformatics, (Borne, 2009; Djorgovski et al., 2006).},

Apart from the storage system, there are also requirements on the software framework to allow efficient data processing, i.e. robustness, execution speed and coding efficiency.

    volume = {43},
    url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFMIN43C..07H},
    abstract = {A plethora of open source technologies for manipulating, transforming,
querying, and visualizing 'big data' have blossomed and matured in the
last few years, driven in large part by recognition of the tremendous
value that can be derived by leveraging data mining and visualization
techniques on large data sets. One facet of many of these tools is that
input data must often be prepared into a particular format (e.g.: JSON,
CSV), or loaded into a particular storage technology (e.g.: HDFS) before
analysis can take place. This process, commonly known as
Extract-Transform-Load, or ETL, often involves multiple well-defined
steps that must be executed in a particular order, and the approach
taken for a particular data set is generally sensitive to the quantity
and quality of the input data, as well as the structure and complexity
of the desired output. When working with very large, heterogeneous,
unstructured or semi-structured data sets, automating the ETL process
and monitoring its progress becomes increasingly important. Apache
Object Oriented Data Technology (OODT) provides a suite of complementary
data management components called the Process Control System (PCS) that
can be connected together to form flexible ETL pipelines as well as
browser-based user interfaces for monitoring and control of ongoing
operations. The lightweight, metadata driven middleware layer can be
wrapped around custom ETL workflow steps, which themselves can be
implemented in any language. Once configured, it facilitates
communication between workflow steps and supports execution of ETL
pipelines across a distributed cluster of compute resources. As
participants in a DARPA-funded effort to develop open source tools for
large-scale data analysis, we utilized Apache OODT to rapidly construct
custom ETL pipelines for a variety of very large data sets to prepare
them for analysis and visualization applications. We feel that OODT,
which is free and open source software available through the Apache
Software Foundation, is particularly well suited to developing and
managing arbitrary large-scale ETL processes both for the simplicity and
flexibility of its wrapper framework, as well as the detailed provenance
information it exposes throughout the process. Our experience using OODT
to manage processing of large-scale data sets in domains as diverse as
radio astronomy, life sciences, and social network analysis demonstrates
the flexibility of the framework, and the range of potential
applications to a broad array of big data ETL challenges.},

The data are processed at the Science Operations Center at NASA Ames Research Center. Because of the large volume of data and the memory needed, as well as the CPU-intensive nature of the analyses, significant computing hardware is required. We have developed generic pipeline framework software that is used to distribute and synchronize processing across a cluster of CPUs and provide data accountability for the resulting products. The framework is written in Java and is, therefore, platform-independent. The framework scales from a single, standalone workstation (for development and research on small data sets) to a full cluster of homogeneous or heterogeneous hardware with minimal configuration changes. A plug-in architecture provides customized, dynamic control of the unit of work without the need to modify the framework. Distributed transaction services provide for atomic storage of pipeline products for a unit of work across a relational database and the custom Kepler DB. Generic parameter management and data accountability services record parameter values, software versions, and other metadata used for each pipeline execution. A graphical user interface allows for configuration, execution, and monitoring of pipelines. The framework was developed for the Kepler Mission based on Kepler requirements, but the framework itself is generic and could be used for a variety of applications where these features are needed.},

    abstract = {The photometric calibration of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a multi-step process which involves data from three different telescopes: the 1.0-m telescope at the US Naval Observatory (USNO), Flagstaff Station, Arizona (which was used to establish the SDSS standard star network); the SDSS 0.5-m Photometric Telescope (PT) at the Apache Point Observatory (APO), New Mexico (which calculates nightly extinctions and calibrates secondary patch transfer fields); and the SDSS 2.5-m telescope at APO (which obtains the imaging data for the SDSS proper). In this paper, we describe the Monitor Telescope Pipeline, MTPIPE, the software pipeline used in processing the data from the single-CCD telescopes used in the photometric calibration of the SDSS (i.e., the USNO 1.0-m and the PT). We also describe transformation equations that convert photometry on the USNO-1.0m u'g'r'i'z' system to photometry the SDSS 2.5m ugriz system and the results of various validation tests of the MTPIPE software. Further, we discuss the semi-automated PT factory, which runs MTPIPE in the day-to-day standard SDSS operations at Fermilab. Finally, we discuss the use of MTPIPE in current SDSS-related projects, including the Southern u'g'r'i'z' Standard Star project, the u'g'r'i'z' Open Star Clusters project, and the SDSS extension (SDSS-II).},
